To run the following examples see the accompanying tutorials that can be found within the
documentation tab on the ISSM webpage. The tutorials were created to be parallel to lectures given,
but the tutorials are up to date on their version of ISSM. However within the workshop directory you
can find the lecture tutorials which will give a more in depth technical overview. If more help is
needed see the Usermanual also found under the documentation tab. If you don't want to complete the
tutorials in chronological order make sure to see Jakobshavn to run the download script.
