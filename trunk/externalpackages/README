To install all the ISSM libraries:

1/ go into each library folder and type install.sh . 

2/ There is no guarantee the compilation will work on all systems. A lot of tweaking of the 
install.sh files will probably be involved. Especially, the configuration part of the install.

Update: 
now install.sh can call configure.sh for the most complex libraries, ie Petsc and Dakota. For those 
libraries, go in the configs/ directory, pick up the correct configuration file and copy it to the top 
folder of the library compilation. Tweak if necessary.
