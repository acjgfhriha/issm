#Note of caution:  stop after boostrap phase, and run 
#bjam --debug-configuration, to figure out which paths boost is using to include 
#python. make sure everyone of these paths is covered by python. If not, just make 
#symlinks in externalpackages/python to what boost is expecting. Ther is NO WAY 
#to get the boost library to include python support without doing that.
