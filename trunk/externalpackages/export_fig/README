We had to patch export_fig.m to force export_fig to use the renderers painter, otherwise it is just way to slow (opengl is the default if we have patches)

Line  585:


if ~options.renderer
    if hasTransparency || hasPatches
        % This is *MUCH* slower, but more accurate for patches and transparent annotations (issue #39)
        renderer = '-opengl';
    else
        renderer = '-painters';
    end
end

change to painters all the time
