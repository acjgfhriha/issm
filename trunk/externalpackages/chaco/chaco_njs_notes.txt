chaco build must be able to see malloc.h
sudo ln -s /usr/include/malloc/malloc.h /usr/include/malloc.h
or else make sure you include the malloc directory in path

if on sierra, you must download a version of malloc.h -
one can be found here: http://web.mit.edu/jhawk/mnt/spo/phone-project/include/malloc.h
place this file in /usr/local/include/, and run the sierra install script
