This directory holds classes corresponding to every cluster 
that can be used. 

Why classes? 
Because handling the specificity of every cluster is hard in a general 
code. Having classes with generic methods, such as: BuildQueueScript, 
LaunchQueueJob,  and internal data corresponding to every cluster's specificity 
is much more manageable and powerful.

How to add your cluster? 
use an existing cluster script, such as pfe.m, and rename it to your cluster name.
update the methods.
